## Business Rules (updated)

- When placing an order, the backend re-validates each item for the latest `min_quantity` and price tiers.
- If the quantity is below the variantâ€™s minimum, the order is rejected.
- The correct price is selected from price tiers based on the ordered quantity.
- This ensures all orders always respect the latest business rules, even if the cart was manipulated.
