# Task 8: Seller Response System - Documentation

## Overview
Task 8 implements the seller response functionality, allowing vendors and wholesalers to respond to customer reviews. This feature enables sellers to engage with customers, address concerns, and provide additional information.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Seller Response Model
The `SellerResponse` model is defined in `models/review.go`:
```go
type SellerResponse struct {
    gorm.Model
    ProductReviewID uint          `json:"product_review_id" gorm:"uniqueIndex"`
    ProductReview   ProductReview `json:"product_review"`
    UserID          uint          `json:"user_id"`
    User            User          `json:"user"`
    Content         string        `json:"content" gorm:"size:500;not null"`
}
```

### 2. API Endpoints

#### POST /api/v1/reviews/:id/response
Creates a new seller response to a review.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "content": "Thank you for your feedback! We appreciate your review."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Seller response created successfully",
    "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "product_review_id": 123,
        "user_id": 456,
        "content": "Thank you for your feedback! We appreciate your review.",
        "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
}
```

#### PUT /api/v1/reviews/:id/response
Updates an existing seller response.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "content": "Updated response content"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Seller response updated successfully",
    "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "product_review_id": 123,
        "user_id": 456,
        "content": "Updated response content",
        "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "updated_at": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
    }
}
```

### 3. Business Rules

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Only authenticated users can create/update responses
- Only users with `Vendor` or `Wholesaler` user types can respond
- Users can only update their own responses

#### Validation Rules
- Content is required and must not exceed 500 characters
- Only one response per review is allowed
- Can only respond to approved reviews
- Content is automatically trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace

#### Ownership Verification
- Currently allows all vendors/wholesalers to respond to all reviews
- Future enhancement: Implement proper product ownership verification when seller-product relationship is established

### 4. Error Handling

#### Common Error Responses

**400 Bad Request - Invalid Request**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
        "message": "Invalid request body or content too long"
    }
}
```

**400 Bad Request - Response Already Exists**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "RESPONSE_EXISTS",
        "message": "A response already exists for this review. Use update endpoint."
    }
}
```

**403 Forbidden - Not Product Owner**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "NOT_PRODUCT_OWNER",
        "message": "You do not own the product for this review"
    }
}
```

**404 Not Found - Review Not Found**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "REVIEW_NOT_FOUND",
        "message": "Review not found or not approved"
    }
}
```

**404 Not Found - Response Not Found**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "RESPONSE_NOT_FOUND",
        "message": "No existing response to update"
    }
}
```

### 5. Database Schema

#### SellerResponse Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE seller_responses (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    product_review_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    content VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_review_response (product_review_id),
    INDEX idx_user_id (user_id),
    INDEX idx_deleted_at (deleted_at)
);
```

### 6. Integration Points

#### Review Display
- Seller responses are included in review retrieval endpoints
- Responses are displayed below the original review content
- Include seller information (name, company) for context

#### Notification System
- Future enhancement: Notify customers when sellers respond to their reviews
- Email/SMS notifications for review responses

### 7. Security Considerations

#### Input Validation
- Content length validation (max 500 characters)
- XSS prevention through proper content sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

#### Access Control
- Role-based access control (Vendor/Wholesaler only)
- User authentication required for all operations
- Ownership verification (placeholder implementation)

### 8. Testing

#### Test Coverage
- ✅ Success scenarios for create and update
- ✅ Duplicate response prevention
- ✅ Content validation (length, required)
- ✅ Authentication and authorization
- ✅ Error handling for various scenarios
- ✅ Database constraint validation

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Create Response Success**: Valid seller creates response to approved review
2. **Update Response Success**: Seller updates existing response
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Attempt to create second response to same review
4. **Content Validation**: Content too long or empty
5. **Authorization**: Non-seller users attempting to respond
6. **Review Status**: Attempting to respond to non-approved reviews

### 9. Performance Considerations

#### Database Optimization
- Unique index on `product_review_id` prevents duplicates
- Index on `user_id` for ownership queries
- Soft delete support for audit trail

#### Caching Strategy
- Consider caching frequently accessed responses
- Cache invalidation on response updates

### 10. Future Enhancements

#### Planned Improvements
1. **Product Ownership**: Implement proper seller-product relationship
2. **Response Templates**: Pre-defined response templates for common scenarios
3. **Response Analytics**: Track response effectiveness and customer satisfaction
4. **Auto-Response**: Automated responses for certain review types
5. **Response Moderation**: Admin approval for responses if needed

#### API Extensions
- GET endpoint to retrieve seller response history
- Bulk response operations for multiple reviews
- Response analytics and reporting endpoints
