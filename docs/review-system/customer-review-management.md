### 5. Database Operations

#### Update Review
1. Verify user ownership and review existence
2. Check review status (must be approved)
3. Update review fields with validation
4. Save changes to database
5. Trigger rating aggregation update

#### Delete Review
1. Verify user ownership and review existence
2. Check review status (must be approved)
3. Soft delete the review
4. Soft delete related data (images, helpful votes, seller responses)
5. Trigger rating aggregation update

#### Get User Reviews
1. Build query with user filter
2. Apply optional status filter
3. Add pagination parameters
4. Preload related data (product variant, product, images, seller response)
5. Return paginated results with metadata

### 6. Integration Points

#### Rating Aggregation
- Rating aggregation is automatically updated when reviews are modified or deleted
- Ensures product rating accuracy across the system

#### Review Display
- Updated reviews are immediately reflected in public review endpoints
- Deleted reviews are excluded from all public displays

#### User Experience
- Customers can manage their review history through the user dashboard
- Review status filtering helps customers track pending/approved reviews

### 7. Security Considerations

#### Access Control
- JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- User ownership verification prevents unauthorized access
- Review status validation prevents manipulation of pending reviews

#### Data Integrity
- Soft delete preserves data for audit purposes
- Related data cleanup prevents orphaned records
- Rating aggregation updates maintain system consistency

#### Input Validation
- Comprehensive validation prevents malicious input
- Content length limits prevent abuse
- Rating range validation ensures data quality

### 8. Testing

#### Test Coverage
- ✅ Success scenarios for update, delete, and retrieval
- ✅ Ownership verification and authorization
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Pagination and filtering functionality
- ✅ Database constraint validation
- ✅ Rating aggregation updates

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Update Review Success**: Valid user updates their own approved review
2. **Delete Review Success**: Valid user deletes their own approved review
3. **Get User Reviews Success**: User retrieves their review history with pagination
4. **Ownership Verification**: Users cannot modify others' reviews
5. **Status Validation**: Only approved reviews can be modified
6. **Input Validation**: Invalid data is properly rejected
7. **Pagination**: Large result sets are properly paginated
8. **Status Filtering**: Reviews can be filtered by status

### 9. Performance Considerations

#### Database Optimization
- Indexes on `user_id` and `status` for efficient filtering
- Preloading of related data reduces N+1 query problems
- Pagination limits result set size

#### Caching Strategy
- Consider caching user review history for frequent access
- Cache invalidation on review updates/deletions

### 10. Future Enhancements

#### Planned Improvements
1. **Review History**: Track review modification history
2. **Bulk Operations**: Allow bulk update/deletion of multiple reviews
3. **Review Templates**: Pre-defined review templates for common scenarios
4. **Review Analytics**: Track review performance and engagement metrics
5. **Review Export**: Allow users to export their review history

#### API Extensions
- Review modification history endpoint
- Bulk review management operations
- Review analytics and reporting endpoints
