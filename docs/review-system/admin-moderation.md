### 2. Business Rules

#### Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Only users with `Admin` user type can access these endpoints
- Admin middleware enforces role-based access control

#### Review Moderation Rules
- Valid status transitions: PENDING → APPROVED/REJECTED/FLAGGED
- Reason is required for all moderation actions (max 500 characters)
- Moderation actions are logged with admin ID and timestamp
- Rating aggregation is updated when status changes to/from APPROVED

#### Review Deletion Rules
- Only admins can permanently delete reviews
- Deletion removes all related data (images, helpful votes, seller responses)
- Deletion actions are logged for audit purposes
- Rating aggregation is updated after deletion

#### Review Listing Rules
- All reviews are visible to admins regardless of status
- Advanced filtering by status, rating, user, and product
- Pagination is enforced (max 100 items per page)
- Reviews are ordered by creation date (newest first)

### 3. Validation Rules

#### ModerationRequest Validation
```go
type ModerationRequest struct {
    Status  models.ReviewStatus `json:"status" binding:"required"`
    Reason  string              `json:"reason" binding:"required,max=500"`
}
```

#### Query Parameter Validation
- `page`: Must be >= 1
- `limit`: Must be between 1-100
- `status`: Must be a valid review status
- `rating`: Must be between 1-5
- `user_id`: Must be a valid user ID
- `product_variant_id`: Must be a valid product variant ID

### 4. Error Handling

#### Common Error Responses

**400 Bad Request - Invalid Request**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
        "message": "Invalid request body"
    }
}
```

**400 Bad Request - Invalid Status**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "INVALID_STATUS",
        "message": "Invalid review status"
    }
}
```

**401 Unauthorized**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
        "message": "Admin not authenticated"
    }
}
```

**404 Not Found - Review Not Found**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "REVIEW_NOT_FOUND",
        "message": "Review not found"
    }
}
```

**500 Internal Server Error**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "DATABASE_ERROR",
        "message": "Failed to retrieve reviews"
    }
}
```

### 5. Database Operations

#### Review Listing
1. Build query with optional filters
2. Apply pagination parameters
3. Preload related data (user, product variant, product, images, seller response)
4. Return paginated results with metadata

#### Review Moderation
1. Verify admin authentication and review existence
2. Validate status transition
3. Update review status and moderation fields
4. Create moderation log entry
5. Update rating aggregation if needed

#### Review Deletion
1. Verify admin authentication and review existence
2. Permanently delete review and related data
3. Create deletion log entry
4. Update rating aggregation

#### Statistics Generation
1. Count reviews by status
2. Count deleted reviews
3. Retrieve recent moderation activity
4. Return aggregated statistics

### 6. Integration Points

#### Rating Aggregation
- Rating aggregation is automatically updated when reviews are moderated
- Ensures product rating accuracy across the system

#### Audit Trail
- All moderation actions are logged with admin details
- Provides complete audit trail for compliance and accountability

#### Review Display
- Moderated reviews are immediately reflected in public endpoints
- Deleted reviews are excluded from all public displays

### 7. Security Considerations

#### Access Control
- JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- Admin role verification prevents unauthorized access
- Comprehensive audit logging for all actions

#### Data Integrity
- Permanent deletion removes all related data
- Moderation logs preserve action history
- Rating aggregation updates maintain system consistency

#### Input Validation
- Comprehensive validation prevents malicious input
- Status validation ensures only valid transitions
- Reason length limits prevent abuse

### 8. Testing

#### Test Coverage
- ✅ Success scenarios for all endpoints
- ✅ Authentication and authorization
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Filtering and pagination functionality
- ✅ Database constraint validation
- ✅ Rating aggregation updates
- ✅ Moderation logging

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Get All Reviews Success**: Admin retrieves reviews with various filters
2. **Moderate Review Success**: Admin approves/rejects reviews
3. **Delete Review Success**: Admin permanently deletes review
4. **Get Stats Success**: Admin retrieves moderation statistics
5. **Authentication**: Non-admin users cannot access endpoints
6. **Input Validation**: Invalid data is properly rejected
7. **Filtering**: Reviews can be filtered by various criteria
8. **Pagination**: Large result sets are properly paginated

### 9. Performance Considerations

#### Database Optimization
- Indexes on status, rating, user_id, and product_variant_id for efficient filtering
- Preloading of related data reduces N+1 query problems
- Pagination limits result set size

#### Caching Strategy
- Consider caching moderation statistics for dashboard display
- Cache invalidation on moderation actions

### 10. Future Enhancements

#### Planned Improvements
1. **Bulk Moderation**: Allow bulk approval/rejection of multiple reviews
2. **Moderation Queue**: Prioritize reviews based on criteria (rating, user history, etc.)
3. **Automated Moderation**: AI-powered content analysis for initial screening
4. **Moderation Templates**: Pre-defined reasons for common moderation actions
5. **Review Appeals**: Allow users to appeal rejected reviews

#### API Extensions
- Bulk moderation operations endpoint
- Moderation queue management
- Review appeal processing
- Advanced analytics and reporting
